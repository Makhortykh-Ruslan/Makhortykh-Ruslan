I'm a Frontend Developer with 4+ years of real-world experience delivering production-ready web apps using Angular and React.
I focus on architecture that scales, code that survives, and a workflow that's typed & chilled â€” fast iterations, strict TypeScript, clear responsibility, no chaos.
Passionate about building systems that are not only functional, but easy to reason about, test, and evolve.
