I’m a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience building production-ready web applications using Angular, React, Next.js and TypeScript.
I focus on architecture that scales, code that lasts, and processes that keep teams fast and sane — typed, predictable, and maintainable!

Passionate about building frontend systems that are easy to reason about, test, and evolve. I care deeply about developer experience, performance, and long-term maintainability.
