I’m a Frontend Engineer with 4+ years of hands-on experience building production-ready web applications with Angular and React.
I focus on scalable architecture, resilient code, and a workflow that’s both typed and chill — fast iterations, strict TypeScript, clear ownership, zero chaos.
I’m passionate about creating systems that are not only functional, but also easy to reason about, test, and evolve.
